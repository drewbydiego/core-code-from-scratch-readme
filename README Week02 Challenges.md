<h2>Logic problem 🎲</h2>
<b>"The teacher asks his 5 students if they studied mathematics yesterday.<br><br>

Alice: "Nobody studied math yesterday".<br>
Bob: "1 person studied math yesterday".<br>
Charlie: "2 people studied math yesterday".<br>
Dan: "3 people studied mathematics yesterday".<br>
Eva: "4 people studied mathematics yesterday".<br><br>

The teacher knows that only those who studied would be telling the truth and those who didn't would be lying. Who is telling the truth?"</b>
<h3>Solution</h3>
<p>Out of the five students, only those who studied math yesterday would tell the truth, and those who didn't would lie. Alice's statement contradicts the rest, so it's false. Bob said one person studied math yesterday, which means Alice's statement is false, and someone did study. Charlie, Dan, and Eva's statements agree that more than one person studied math yesterday. Since three people cannot have studied math yesterday, Eva's statement is false, and two people studied math yesterday. Therefore, the only student telling the truth is Charlie, who said that two people studied math yesterday.</p>

<h1>Week challenges (Tuesday) 💻</h1>
<h2>Install PSeInt 🖥️</h2>
<b>For this week we are going to use a program called PSeInt, this tool will help us to understand key programming concepts using a pseudocode language. The description of this tool is the following:</b><br><br><p>"It is a tool to assist a student in their first steps in programming.
Through a simple and intuitive pseudo-language in Spanish (complemented by a flowchart editor),
it allows you to focus your attention on the fundamental concepts of computational algorithms,
minimizing the difficulties of a language and providing a work environment with numerous aids and teaching resources."</p>

<h2>Print my name & age 🐱‍💻</h2>
<b>"This challenge is similar to the previous guided challenge, but now you will try alone. For this challenge, you will need to create an algorithm in Pseudocode using PSeInt that prints your name and your age in separate lines, remeber that your name should be a string and your age a number"</b>

<h1>Week challenges (Thursday) 💻</h1>
<h2>Truth tables 🧑‍🏫</h2>
<b>"You are going to learn about three main logical operations used in programming, these operations are called AND, OR, and NOT. Each of the operations uses booleans as operands, and when applying the operations a result is generated, which is also a boolean, this is easier to check using the Truth Tables for each of the operations, now your task is for you to learn, and add the Truth Tables for each of the operations add them to your README and check if the following operations are correct by answering ✅ or ❌ at the end of each operation"</b>
<h3>Solution</h3><br>
<ol>
  <li>T & T = T ✅</li>
  <li>T & F = F ✅</li>
  <li>F & T = T ❌</li>
  <li>F & F = F ✅</li>

<h2>Boolean results ✍🏻</h2>
<b>"You have been assigned to verify and explain a code created by one of your colleagues, the idea is that you can describe the value that each variable has within the code as well as what was done for each line. What is expected of you is that you add comments below each line showing the value that the variable would have and a short explanation of how that value is reached."</b><br>
This is the code:<br><br>

Algoritmo boolean<br>
	a <- 5 == 3<br>
	b <- 4 <> 3<br>
	c <- 7 > 7<br>
	d <- 4 < 4<br>
	e <- 100 <= 90<br>
	f <- 40 >= 40<br>

<h3>Solution</h3><br>
Algoritmo boolean

    a <- 5 == 3      // a = falso
    // The '==' operator checks if the left and right operands are equal. Since 5 is not equal to 3, the value of a is false.
    
    b <- 4 <> 3      // b = verdadeiro
    // The '<>' operator checks if the left and right operands are not equal. Since 4 is not equal to 3, the value of b is true.
    
    c <- 7 > 7       // c = falso
    // The '>' operator checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand. Since 7 is not greater than 7, the value of c is false.
    
    d <- 4 < 4       // d = falso
    // The '<' operator checks if the left operand is less than the right operand. Since 4 is not less than 4, the value of d is false.
    
    e <- 100 <= 90   // e = falso
    // The '<=' operator checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand. Since 100 is not less than or equal to 90, the value of e is false.
    
    f <- 40 >= 40    // f = verdadeiro
    // The '>=' operator checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand. Since 40 is equal to 40, the value of f is true.

<h2>Identify odd and even numbers👨🏻‍💻</h2>
<b>"Remember the last challenge about the Mod operator? well, today your task will be to create a program that will be able to detect based on the user input if the number is odd or even. The process should be the following:"</b><br><br>

1. The user enters a number
2. Your algorithm detects if the number is odd or even (remember to use conditional statements Si...Entonces)
3. Print ‘Número: x es par’ if the number is even (x is the number the user enters)
4. Print ‘Número: x es impar’ if the number is odd (x is the number the user enters)
<h3>Solution</h3><br>

Algoritmo DetectarNumeroParImpar

    Escribir "Por favor ingrese un número: "
    Leer numero

    Si numero % 2 == 0 Entonces
        Escribir "Número: " , numero , " es par"
    SiNo
        Escribir "Número: " , numero , " es impar"
